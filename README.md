## SymmetricCryptoChatRoom ([Heroku Url](https://symmetric-crypto-chat-room.herokuapp.com/))

Simple secure chat room web (+ file transfer) application using SignalR (dotnet core) and Angular.js for front-end and most importantly:
- `SHA-256` to hash the given password
- `AES-256-CTR` to encrypt/decrypt the messages

### Note
- `password` is never sent via a socket, You are responsible to exchange the symmetric key
- Both encryption and decryption is all done in client-slide, only ciphertexts are transmitted via Sockets
- File name is transmitted as plaintext but file blob is transmitted as ciphertext
- Max file size is `50mb`
- Session password is store as plaintext via a cookie in your browser
